Anas ibn Malik reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “A time of patience will come to people in which adhering to one’s religion is like grasping a hot coal.”  -- [Sunan al-Tirmidhī 2260]

Internet is get small for the those who want adhere to the principal of Islam, it can be as simple as to buy something, read news, chat with friends and all the halal things one can do, but to have a free mind while doing such things is getting tedious.
While your buying even if you want buy directly,they prompt you for continuously for EMI (a form of Ribba).
While reading news, they will prompt you for different celebrities.
While chating with friends, they will prompt you to talk to some strangers.  

it feels like the Internet is shrinking in what we do everyday.
